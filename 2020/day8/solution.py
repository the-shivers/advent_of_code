# Part 2
# Brute force would be totally viable here (n^2)
# But maybe we can do better.
# Suppose we have dictionaries indicating the "what this leads to" and "what leads to this"
# From here we could work backwards...

# Or maybe we should think about this as a decision tree. 
# Every time we hit a nop or jmp we split and explore both paths. 
# Hm... but we can do better than this too. There are going to be subproblems.
# Or are there?
# Maybe we can do some small optimizations. If the redirect sends us to a node we already visited... then it's obviously no good.
# Okay, this sounds like a good strategy. The set essentially saves us from a lot of work.

# So which increment actually gets us to the last line? 
# Okay new approach, let's build double dictionaries (like we did last time). 
# Then we can solve the maze backwards.
# We will simply identify which paths could possibly (flipped or not) lead to the last space
# Then find the paths that could lead to that. 
# And so on and so forth.
# Wait this is retarded, it's literally the same problem. 
# Let's just get the BROOT done for now.
